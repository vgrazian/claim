# Claim - Rust CLI Application

A command-line application for processing claims with API key authentication.

## NAME

claim - Monday.com claim management tool

## SYNOPSIS

**claim** [*OPTIONS*]

**claim** **query** [*QUERY_OPTIONS*]

**claim** **add** [*ADD_OPTIONS*]

## DESCRIPTION

**claim** is a command-line application for processing claims with Monday.com API integration. It provides secure API key storage, interactive setup, and functionality to query and add claim entries to Monday.com boards.

The application automatically handles API key validation, stores credentials securely in the system configuration directory, and provides both interactive and command-line modes for claim management.

## FIRST-TIME SETUP

On first execution, the application will prompt for a Monday.com API key:

```bash
cargo run
# or if built:
./target/release/claim
```

**Output:**
```text
No API key found. Let's set one up!
Please enter your API key:
[your input here]
API key saved successfully!
```

### Getting Your Monday.com API Key

1. Log in to your Monday.com account
2. Go to https://your-account.monday.com/admin/integrations/api
3. Generate a new API key or use an existing one
4. Copy the API key when prompted by the application

### API Key Validation

The application validates your API key by:
1. Testing the connection to Monday.com's API
2. Retrieving your user information (ID, name, email)
3. Only saving the API key if validation succeeds

### API Permissions

Your Monday.com API key needs the following permissions:
- Read access to user information
- Access to the GraphQL API

## USAGE

### Subsequent Runs

After the initial setup, the application will automatically use the stored API key:

```bash
cargo run
# or if built:
./target/release/claim
```

**Output:**
```text
Running for user id *****, user name ***** *****, email ******** for year ####
No command specified. Use --help for available commands.
```

## COMMANDS

### query

Query claims from Monday.com board.

```bash
claim query [--date DATE] [--days DAYS] [--limit LIMIT] [-v]
```

**Options:**
- `-D, --date DATE`: Date to filter claims (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY.MM.DD, or YYYY/MM/DD format)
- `-d, --days DAYS`: Number of working days to query (default: 1, skips weekends)
- `--limit LIMIT`: Number of rows to display (default: 5)
- `-v, --verbose`: Verbose output

**Examples:**
```bash
# Query a single day
claim query -D 2025-09-15

# Query a full work week (5 days starting from specified date)
claim query -D 2025-09-15 -d 5

# Query 10 days with increased limit and verbose output
claim query -D 2025-09-01 -d 10 --limit 20 -v
```

**Output for multi-day query:**
```text
Running for user id *****, user name ***** *****, email ******** for year ####

**Finding Item IDs:**
To find the ID of an item you want to delete:
1. Run `claim query` to list your claims
2. Look for the `ID: **********` value in the output
3. Use that ID with the delete command

## CONFIGURATION FILE LOCATION

The API key is stored in a JSON configuration file. The location varies by operating system:

### Linux
```
~/.config/claim/config.json
```

### macOS
```
~/Library/Application Support/com.yourname.claim/config.json
```

### Windows
```
C:UsersUsernameAppDataRoamingyournameclaimconfigconfig.json
```

## SECURITY NOTES

- The API key is stored in plain text (though in a protected system directory)
- When displayed, only the first 4 characters are shown, followed by asterisks
- The config file is created with standard file permissions for your user account
- API keys are validated before being saved to ensure they work with Monday.com
- If you need to change your API key, you must manually delete the configuration file

## ERROR HANDLING

If you encounter connection errors:
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check your internet connection
3. Ensure your Monday.com account is active
4. Verify API key permissions
5. Check that the Monday.com board structure matches expected format

## Monday.com Integration

This application connects to Monday.com using your API key to retrieve user information and verify authentication. It specifically works with boards that have the following column structure:
- Person column (user assignment)
- Date column (claim date)
- Status column (activity type)
- Text columns (customer, work item)
- Numbers column (hours)

The application automatically handles weekend skipping when adding multiple days and provides comprehensive error handling for API interactions.

### Multi-Day Query Features

The query command with the `-d` option provides:
- **Automatic weekend skipping** - Only business days are included in the range
- **Simplified table view** - Clean summary format for multiple days
- **Multiple entries per day support** - Handles cases where users have multiple claims on the same date
- **Total hours calculation** - Automatic sum of hours across the period
- **Empty day indication** - Shows dates with no entries for complete timeline

### Activity Type Mapping

The application maps between human-readable activity types and their corresponding numeric values:

| Activity Type    | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| vacation         | 0     |
| billable         | 1     |
| holding          | 2     |
| education        | 3     |
| work_reduction   | 4     |
| tbd              | 5     |
| holiday          | 6     |
| presales         | 7     |
| illness          | 8     |
| boh1             | 9     |
| boh2             | 10    |
| boh3             | 11    |
